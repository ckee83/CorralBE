If you just pulled this repository, you will need to install the dependencies and create a local.js

To install the dependencies:

Windows 
	- In command prompt, navigate to the root directory (where app.js is)
	- Type 'node install' and hit enter
	- That's all! (It will take a moment)

	
To create a local.js:
	- In the config folder (rootFolder/config) there is a file called localDefault.js
	- If you know what you are doing, you can create a custom local.js file.
	- If not, you can copy localDefault.js, then rename the copy 'local.js'
