Bcrypt depends on node-gyp, Visual Studio (express works), and Python 2.7

You will have to do the following:

- Install Python 2.7
- Install Visual Studio
- Install node-gyp using 'npm install -g node-gyp --save'
	*If it complains that Python isn't found, you can use the following to set the path:
		node-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7
